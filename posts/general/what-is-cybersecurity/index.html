			<p>There are several definitions of what is cybersecurity depending on where you search. The one site that I think best describes it is Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity, computer security or IT security is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data, and code injection. Also, due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional or accidental, IT security is susceptible to being tricked into deviating from secure procedures through various methods.”</p>
<p>We will break this definition into pieces to understand where cybersecurity comes from:</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a compound word from “Cyber” and “security”. Many websites, such as Oxford Dictionaries, state that it came to be in the 1940’s, but is not true. It was widely used starting in the 1940’s, but for the back then recently created field that studied the interaction of living beings with machines and to classify what was known as cybernetics.</p>
<p>Again, if you search for the word “Cyber”, the only website that provides the closest to the etymology of the definition is Wikipedia. According to Wikipedia, the etymology of the word “Cyber” came “from the Greek for skilled in steering or governing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The word security, although we might be heard it many times for different things in our life, in this case, it refers to secure and protect something from external forces and from unwanted changes. Put both definitions together and we have “to secure and protect what is being steered and governed”. Translated into our daily lives, it means &ldquo;to secure the information and to protect the assets that create such information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concept of Cybersecurity sometimes gets so confusing for some people that the only thing that comes to their mind is that this is a synonym to computers in the form of desktops or laptops, but this isn’t Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It is more of a holistic field that takes its form from the different specialties that came to be through time and together converged into what today is the discipline known as Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Stay tuned as we will be discussing the different specialties and subspecialties in detail of this beautiful field on later posts, as they will require their own attention.</p>
<p><strong>Computer security</strong></p>
<p>The word computer refers to any hardware that can compute a specific pre-programmed process. For example:</p>
<p>The remote control of your TV or</p>
<p>Today’s TV, which already has a built-in computer to provide you the multimedia entertainment via pre-installed apps.</p>
<p>Your Smartphone</p>
<p>Digital camera or Video camera</p>
<p>Any “Internet of Things” (IoT) device, which is the term that refers to any home device you can connect to the Internet, mostly to control or monitor such device remotely from anywhere in the planet.</p>
<p>And the list goes on and on…</p>
<p><strong>IT security</strong></p>
<p>The word “IT” means Information Technology. This is a field of its own as it encompasses the various specialties that together form “IT”. This field refers to the way people and corporations leverage technology to communicate and store their information.</p>
<p>In the beginning, people were communicating with each other via paper mail they sent via the post office namely United States Postal Service (USPS). The way technology facilitated our lives by the foregoing paper mail was by someone creating a system known as electronic mail or “email”.</p>
<p>People could send and receive emails just by using their computer terminals (a.k.a. “dumb terminals”), which were interconnected into a “mainframe”. Later, everyone that was required received what became to be known as a personal computer (PC).</p>
<p>I still remember the “ol’ days” of America Online email sound in my snaily dial-up connected computer saying “You’ve got mail !”.</p>
<p>The email system uses its own communication protocol and server ports to transmit and receive such communication. Today, it doesn't matter if you use Gmail or Yahoo Mail or you use your own private email server, the way an email system works is basically similar.</p>
<p>Later, people in large corporations wanted to do more than just send simple conversations to each other via email. They also wanted to send sensitive documents and reports to be shared with specific colleagues for which the storage server was born.</p>
<p>Back then the system administrator had to make a choice between using the same email server as a storage server to cut costs or use a separate server for the purpose of storing and sharing these documents. As business grew they had to choose the latter.</p>
<p>A computer server requires being in a secure and locked place. As business kept growing so did the security implementation to access these servers and their respective systems, both physically and virtually.</p>
<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p>
<p>Now that I have provided you with the elements of any computer system:</p>
<p>System User (Remember the email user?)</p>
<p>Personal Computer</p>
<p>email system</p>
<p>Servers.</p>
<p>We will see how all of these fits together into the definition of what is cybersecurity.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity, computer security or IT security is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.”</p>
<p>From the hardware perspective, it refers to securing the physical assets of such systems. These are the PC, Server and any peripheral attached to them, for example, a printer or any external device.</p>
<p>In the case of the PC, it is rarely physically secured, unless it is a shared computer that provided sensitive information. In some cases, it could be placed into an enclosure, such as a kiosk. To protect the software installed on these PCs, an access control is required. This access control comes in several forms such as a password, biometrics, tokens, code generators application, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of the server, It has to be physically secured. Physical isolation of the servers is required to establish the first perimeter of protection. Physical access to such servers is only granted to the authorized personnel by the administrator in charge of this room or computer room. The protection of the software installed on these servers is similar to how it is in the PCs.</p>
<p>But what about the “Information” that flows in between the PCs and to the servers?</p>
<p>We have established some basic form of access control for the hardware and software installed or contained within the PCs and Servers. Regarding the information, there are two states that we need to consider in order to establish the best form of protection for the information. These two states are stored information and information in transit.</p>
<p>Stored information requires protecting such asset by establishing encryption controls in the PCs and Servers. Users can store documents and files in their PCs and in the servers, and this information requires to be protected somehow. These form of protections is outside the scope of this post but basically think of it as locking the door of your house, where no one can access the place except with a key.</p>
<p>Protecting the information while in transit requires a different approach. The goal of protecting the information while in transit from Point A to Point B is to make sure that anyone not authorized that intercepts such information, can’t read it.</p>
<p>Information leaving your computer (Point A), needs to be “prepared” or “packaged” into a specific format that only the authorized person logged into the computer in Point B can read this information. As I said before, the goal is to make sure that anyone not authorized that intercepts this information while in transit can’t be able to read it or understand it, as it will be encrypted. Only the authorized person logged into the computer in Point B can read this information.</p>
<p><strong>Protection “from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide”</strong></p>
<p>The protection from disruption is when a process is in place to monitor the overall system’s single components or nodes. From the user’s computer to the servers being used every single component is monitored one way or another to prevent the system from going down or to avoid a disruption of the service.</p>
<p>Misdirection can take many forms. The two most common forms are credential harvesting and rerouted traffic.</p>
<p>In the case of credential harvesting, the protection from misdirection requires to train and keep users educated in how to protect themselves from the different types of scams.</p>
<p>The protection from rerouted traffic requires a more technical approach by implementing tools that should guarantee the availability of information.</p>
<p>If you are interested, the subjects of email, communication protocol and server ports can be discussed in later posts. Just make sure to leave some comments requesting it.</p>
